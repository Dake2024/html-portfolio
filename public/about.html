<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My motherland is Taraz, city in the South of Kazakhstan. Taraz is known for its history, because it is located on the Great Silk Road also, Taraz is knowless across Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan because of its criminal times. I was born in 2005 19 Jan. Now I am 18 and searching for myself in IT since I connected my lif with it in 8th grade when I was applying to IT lyceum. However the last year of my shool education was in gymnasyium but anyways, it played a big role in my life.</p>

<p>Thoughts about my future and how I am going to achieve my goals appeared at the end of 10th grade.To be honest it was affected by some factors which often form teenage psychology. It was the first unrequited love, sport, and bad academic progress. But fortunately I took took the helm and began to change my thoughts and body. Thoughts about first love still visit me, but not as often as it was at school. As my consciousness grew, I started studying better and demonstrated better perfomance across all my life criterias but one thing struggled me at those years, I did not knew who I wanna be in future. My search of my talents stopped when I realized that I am struggled with physics but I still love mathmatics. Here I have got a clear vision that I have better maagerial skills or talents which are not revealed.

<p> Having a good results on ENT (national test, through which the majority of kazakh students get a scholarship for university studies) I applied to Astana IT University. My family wanted better for me and adviced study in Almaty for logistics or studies abroad, it was also my dream but I did not achieved this goal. From the start of this year I slightly moved to self studies and reserached Front-end development. I was working on web sites using Tilda platform and then sol 3 websites for a good money and now I am working on the 4th. My prices and perfomance are growing but as soon I was working on that I realized that it is not a good job for me. Now, 0:53 pm 26.06.2023 and I am writing this sentence. I 
  could not return the scholarship, which in fact was the only and most reliable permanent, passive income. This summer already started and I want to make my CV better b adding here Flutter development and skilled Front-end engineer. Also I am planning to apply for abroad in Hungary and other countries in Europe. I hope I can do that in this summer. Also, in my plans, there is a building better body(make 65 killograms, now I am 57kg) and I am going to reach that through a proper nutririon, good trainee,gym and workout. Moreover I wanted to stay in Almaty for the summer weeekends but unfortunately I am useless to market nowadays, so I am going to make bootcamp for myself in Taraz. I wish good luck for myself.</p>
